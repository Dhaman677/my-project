In this experiment, I have made a webpage for depositing and withdrawing money from a bankaccount using both HTML and CSS.
In the HTML part we have made two classes Inner_box and Outer_box holding a heading to show current balance and two buttosn one for depositing and another for withdrawing the money.
These elemenets are designed in an external css file called exp2.css.
The css file sets the background of the webpage to light gray while also giving green and red color to the deposit and withdraw button respectively.
The css file also provides a card like appearence to the interface by smoothing out the corners using flexbox.

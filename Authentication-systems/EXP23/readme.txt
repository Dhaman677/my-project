This project demonstrates how to secure Express.js API routes using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Only authenticated users with a valid token can access protected routes.

Features

Login Route: Authenticate user and issue JWT.

Protected Route: Accessible only with a valid JWT token.

JWT Verification Middleware: Ensures route security.

Simple hardcoded user authentication for demonstration.

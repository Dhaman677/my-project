This project is a simple real-time chat application built using React for the frontend and Express.js with Socket.io for the backend.
It allows multiple users to connect, send, and receive live messages instantly without refreshing the page.
Each user joins with a custom name, and system messages are shown when users connect or disconnect.
The backend handles real-time socket connections, message broadcasting, and user tracking.
The frontend uses Axios and Socket.io-client for API and socket communication.
The chat interface updates dynamically using React state and hooks.
This project demonstrates frontend-backend integration, real-time data flow, and event-based architecture.
Itâ€™s ideal for learning how to connect React and Express using WebSockets.
To run: start the Express server, then start the React client, and open the app in two browsers to chat live.

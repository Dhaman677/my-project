This project is an E-commerce Catalog API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
It represents products with fields like name, price, category, and nested variants (color, size, stock).
The API demonstrates MongoDB’s flexible nested document structure for handling complex product data.
Implemented endpoints allow full CRUD operations – add, view, update, and delete products.
You can fetch all products, filter by category, or search by variant attributes such as color.
Projection queries return only selected fields like variant stock and color for optimized responses.
The project is fully testable in Postman, making API interaction easy and intuitive.
This setup is a practical model for building scalable real-world e-commerce platforms.

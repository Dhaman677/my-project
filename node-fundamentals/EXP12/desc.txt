Description:
This project implements a simple Ticket Booking API using Express.js. 
It allows users to view available seats, temporarily lock a seat, confirm a booking, 
or release a locked seat. Seats are stored in an in-memory array with status management. 
A lock timeout mechanism automatically releases seats if not confirmed within 10 seconds.

Features:
- GET /           → Displays a welcome message
- GET /seats      → Lists all seats with their status (available, locked, booked)
- POST /lock/:id  → Locks a seat for a user for 10 seconds
- POST /confirm/:id → Confirms the booking of a locked seat
- POST /release/:id → Releases a locked seat back to available

This is  a experiment to show: the maling of a employee managment system using node js
in this experiment we have used
readline is a built-in Node.js module that allows reading input from the command line.
employees is an array that will store employee objects, each with id and name.
Created an interface rl to interact with the user through the terminal.
process.stdin reads input, process.stdout displays output.
the show menu function prints the menu.
rl.question asks the user for input.
switch decides what function to call based on the userâ€™s choice.
If input is invalid, the menu is shown again.
addemployee function asks for Employee ID.
Checks if the ID already exists using some().
If unique, asks for Employee Name, then adds the employee to the employees array.
Confirms addition and shows the menu again.
Printemployees prints all employee.
if there are no employees, it shows a message.
Returns to the menu afterwards.
removeemplovee asks for Employee ID to remove.
Finds the employee index with findIndex.
If found, removes it from the array using splice and confirms removal.
If not found, shows an error message.
Returns to the menu.

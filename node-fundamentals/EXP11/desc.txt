Description: 
This project implements a simple RESTful API using Express.js to manage a collection of playing cards. 
The card data is stored in an in-memory array for simplicity. 
The API demonstrates routing, handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE), 
and basic data manipulation in a Node.js backend environment.

Features:
- GET /        → Displays a welcome message and available API endpoints
- GET /cards   → Retrieves all playing cards in the collection
- GET /cards/:id → Retrieves a specific card by its ID
- POST /cards  → Adds a new card (requires "suit" and "value" in JSON body)
- DELETE /cards/:id → Deletes a card from the collection by its ID

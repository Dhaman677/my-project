In this experiment i have made a admin dashboard webpage using html and css
This admin dash board contains:
1. A header
2. A sidebar for navigation
3. A main content area 
4. A footer
5. A switch theme for light  and dark mode

The layout is structured with CSS Grid to divide the page into a header, sidebar navigation, main content area, and footer
Flexbox is used within the header for proper alignment of elements

How  the dark theme works:
1.User clicks the "Dark Theme" button which checks the hidden checkbox
2.CSS checks input
3.The sibling div gets variable color value 
4.All elements inside div change color automatically
